## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK `^3.10.7`
- Dart SDK `^3.0`
- Firebase project (see setup below)

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Israa-e/Finance-Companion.git
cd finance-companion
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

### Firebase Setup

1. Create a Firebase project at [console.firebase.google.com](https://console.firebase.google.com)
2. Enable **Authentication** (Email/Password) and **Firestore Database**
3. Run `flutterfire configure` to generate `firebase_options.dart`
4. Replace `lib/firebase_options.dart` with your generated file

## 🐛 Bug Fixes Applied (v1.1.0)

| # | Issue | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Notification bell navigated to Insights (broken UX) | Replaced with real `NotificationsScreen` — spending alerts, goal deadlines, streak milestones |
| 2 | Streak counted all no-transaction days (false positives) | Added manual "Confirm no-spend today" button; days older than 7 days require explicit confirmation |
| 3 | `_SevenDayDots` used untyped `var streak` | Changed to `final StreakModel streak` (explicit type) |
| 4 | `updatedUser` in `EditProfileSheet` was built but never used | Removed dead variable; `updateProfileWithBalance` called directly |
| 5 | `GoalRepository` and `TransactionRepository` used destructive `db.delete()` before syncing | Replaced with safe per-record upsert (`ConflictAlgorithm.replace`) with explicit delete of removed remote records |
| 6 | `AuthRepository._ensureLocalUser` silently swallowed exceptions | Each failure path now throws a descriptive exception; offline fallback is explicit and logged |
| 7 | Insights had no time-period selector | Added `InsightsPeriod` enum (This Month / Last 3 Months / Last 6 Months / All Time) with chip row UI |
| 8 | No meaningful tests | Added 14 unit/widget tests covering formatters, filter logic, grouping, and balance calculation |
| 9 | `DatabaseHelper` had no migration path | Bumped to version 2 with `onUpgrade` handler; adds `notifications` table on existing installs |

---

## 🚀 Enhancements (v1.2.0)

| # | Feature | Improvement |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Predictive Analytics | Added `BurnRateCard` to Insights (this month only) to project budget breach dates |
| 2 | Advanced Filtering | Implemented multi-category selection and date-range filtering in the transaction list |
| 3 | Visual Quality Assurance | Added **Golden UI Tests** with a custom `FontTestHelper` for cross-OS rendering consistency |
| 4 | Offline First Design | Migrated to bundled local **Poppins** fonts for zero-latency offline typography |
| 5 | Deep-linked Alerts | Tapped budget notifications now jump directly to the Transactions screen |
| 6 | Smart Logic | Integrated weekday vs. weekend spending variance analysis into predictive insights |
| 7 | Success Feedback | Added **Haptic Feedback** and **Confetti Celebrations** for significant goal milestones |
| 8 | Connectivity Indicators | Added a "breathing" status bar to show SQLite ↔ Firebase synchronization status |

## 🎨 Design System

| Token | Value |
|---|---|
| Primary | `#7C6FFF` (purple) |
| Income | `#2ECC89` (green) |
| Expense | `#FF5063` (red) |
| Savings | `#F5A623` (amber) |
| Font | Poppins (Google Fonts) |
| Border Radius | 12–28px |

---

## 🧪 Running Tests

```bash
flutter test
```

Tests cover:
- App launch smoke test
- `CurrencyFormatter` (6 cases)
- `TransactionLoaded` filter logic (7 cases)
- `groupedTransactions` date grouping (2 cases)

---

## 📄 Assumptions

- The monthly budget for spending alerts is fetched from the **UserProfile** provided during session initialization. The `InsightsCubit` uses this value to calculate burn rates and projected breach dates.
- The streak "benefit of the doubt" window is 7 days — days within the last week with no logged expenses are counted as no-spend without requiring confirmation. Days older than 7 days require explicit confirmation via the card button.
- Firestore is the source of truth when online. SQLite is the fallback when offline. On reconnection, the next data fetch will re-sync.
